# 🃏 Card Draw Simulator

A simple interactive card drawing simulator built in the browser.

## 🔍 Overview

This project simulates drawing cards from a shuffled deck. Cards are drawn one at a time from the top of the deck and displayed visually on the screen. Users will eventually be able to:

- Drag and move drawn cards around the screen
- See probability statistics for upcoming cards
- Reset and reshuffle the deck
- Change card highlight color
- Change background image

The simulator is being built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks yet), focusing on interactivity and visual feedback.
